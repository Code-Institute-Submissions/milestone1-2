## Steven A. Horne Art & Photography

My project will advertise myself as an artist and photographer and will aim to 
advertise my services and showcase my work. It will provide a single location
for people to read about me, my skills, my interests, my work and what services
I provide.

Will will aim to provide an unique and friendly experience where people can feel
free to look at what have done, do now and can do.  

## UX

The project will focus on anyone with an interest in art or photography or for 
those looking for an artist or photographer for a project, gift, commission or
any project they have in mind.

### User Stories

As an artist, I want to look at the artists work so that I can get inspiration
for my own work, or a commission.

As a photographer, I want to see what type of photography has been covered, to 
see if it's something I already do or not.

As a customer I want to be able to browse through the artist/photographer's work 
to see if there is anything suitable for use as a gift or use in a project.

As a customer I want to be able to contact the owner of the work to enquire
about sales or a commission.

As a user I want to be able to view a gallery of the owner's work.

The project will use Mobile First so people on the move will have the same 
experience as those who are not.
